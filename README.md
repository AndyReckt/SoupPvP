# SoupPvP

### SoupPvP Core
Hello there everyone, my name is damt and this core has been created just to add something spicy to my portfolio. All concepts and all code that is stated should work right now. 
However, know that the code is still **not** tested!

### API
You can check information on the API via the wiki, or by clicking [here](https://github.com/therealdamt/SoupPvP/wiki/API)!

### Optimization
I've tried to optimize the plugin to my hardest, saving happens per 5 minutes to help the server not lag. Everything saves onto the mongo and nothing really to the config.yml.

### Configuration
You can check out information on the configuration via the wiki, or by clicking [here](https://github.com/therealdamt/SoupPvP/wiki/Configuration)!

### Data Storage
You can choose between 2 of the following data storages:
* YML Storage
* Mongo Storage 

### Permissions
